							<h4>Hello, I'm Mike!</h4>
							<p>I am a Sarplaninac owner, myself, and I am very passionate about these spectacular dogs! I met my first Sarplaninac 
								almost 15 years ago, and I have never been the same since (I mean that in the <em>best</em> way possible). 
								I've always been a lover of animals and nature, but the Sarplaninac struck me as something extremely unique and intelligent. 
								I had never met another dog like the Sarplaninac, and since rescuing my first one, I have truly enjoyed being a steward of 
								the breed.</p>

							<p>Livi, my first Sarplaninac, was brought directly over from Serbia as a puppy. I was fortunate to know her for a few years 
								from her original family. In 2012, when Livi was 7 years old, she officially became my dog. I had a few wonderful years 
								with her before she passed. She was such an amazing dog and is always in my heart.</p>

							<p>These days, my family now has 4 other Sarplaninacs working 40 acres in Colorado. They protect the property, the home, and 
								the family. We have 2 females and 3 males, including my boy, Lucas. I have had Lucas since he was 8 weeks old and he is 
								now 7 years old and a wonderful dog who works part-time on my family's property.</p>

							<p>Each Sarplaninac I have ever met is unique; they all have their own personalities, their own likes and dislikes, 
								and living with a Sarplaninac is in many ways like living with another 
								person. I live and breathe Sarplaninacs and will forever be an advocate for their well-being and someone who wants to help educate the world about this amazing 
								breed of working dog. They add so much joy and purpose to my life, and I am grateful to have been introduced to them so 
								many years ago. I have met amazing people along the way, thanks to these dogs, and I am excited to continue this journey.</p>
							<p>I am a front-end engineer and this is a personal project of mine that I will grow and continue to develop my skills through. I want to take this chance to say <b>thank you</b> to everyone who helped me with information and photography for this project.</p> 
							<p>Also, thank <b>you</b> for visiting my site, and if you would like to see more of my work, you can do so by visiting my personal portfolio <b><a href="https://themikelopez.github.io" target="_blank" title="Mike's Portfolio Site" >here</a></b>.</p>
