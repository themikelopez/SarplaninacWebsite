							<h3 class="align-C">Breed Information</h3>
							<div class="content">
								<p>Although they are not the largest of the available options when it comes to livestock guardian breeds, the Sarplaninac is characterized as having immense strength, accompanied by a set of large teeth, making it a force to be reckoned with when confronting predatory animals.
									</p>
								<p>Their temperament includes being highly intelligent and independent, extremely loyal to their flock and family members, suspicious of strangers and quick to react if they perceive them a threat, and fearless protectors. While not hesitating to confront any danger, Sarplaninacs are also gentle, calm, and steady guardians of the family and flock.
