								<p>Although they are not the largest of the available options when it comes to livestock guardian breeds, the Sarplaninac is charachterized as having immense strength, accompanied by a set of large teeth, making it a force to be reckoned with when confronting predatory animals.
									</p>
								<p>Like many livestock guardian breeds, their temperament includes being highly intelligent and independent, extremely loyal to their flock and family members, suspicious of strangers and quick to react if they perceive them a threat, and fearless. While not hesitating to confront any danger, they are also gentle, calm, and steady guardians of the family and flock.
