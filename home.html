								<p>Sarplaninacs have been developed over thousands of years across the mountainous regions of (former) Yugoslavia.
									 These effective livestock guardians have been protecting flocks alongside shepherds for centuries, carefully
									  selected for their loyalty, intelligence, bravery, and their tenderness with the flock/family.

								<p>Although they are not the largest of the available options when it comes to livestock guardian breeds, the Sarplaninac is characterized as having immense strength, accompanied by a set of large teeth, making it a force to be reckoned with when confronting predatory animals.
									</p>
								<p>Their temperament includes being highly intelligent and independent, extremely loyal to their flock and family members, suspicious of strangers and quick to react if they perceive them a threat, and fearless protectors. While not hesitating to confront any danger, Sarplaninacs are also gentle, calm, and steady guardians of the family and flock.
