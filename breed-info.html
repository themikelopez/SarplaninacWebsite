							<h3 class="align-C">General Appearance</h3>
							<p>The Sarplaninac is a well-proportioned and robust breed of working dog. They can appear bigger than they are due to a large bone mass and a thick, coarse and long double-coat. With iron-grey being a very common coat color, the Sarplaninac's coat can range from solid white to a very dark brown that is nearly black. Their ears are drop and V-shaped and their tails are long and carried like a saber.</p>

							<h3 class="align-C">Temperament</h3>
							<p>Like many livestock guardian breeds, the Sarplaninac is highly <strong> intelligent</strong> and <strong>independent</strong>. If they do not have a flock to protect, their "flock" will take the form of the family. To their masters, they are <strong>loyal</strong> and unwavering. Sarplaninac are typically very <strong>suspicious of strangers</strong> in the absence of a trusted family member. With an even keel, they are <strong>calm and steady</strong> guardians; however, if they perceive a threat, they are <strong>quick to react</strong> and <strong>fearlessly will protect</strong> their flock. Being the independent thinkers that they are, Sarplaninac are not very subservient; They require a strong leader, but also not a domination driven relationship. They are a fairly <strong>stubborn, strong and dominant</strong> breed and therefore are not recommended for new dog owners who are unfamiliar with handling large breeds.</p>

							<p>Although they are not the largest of the available options when it comes to livestock guardian breeds, the Sarplaninac is characterized as having immense strength, accompanied by a set of large teeth, making it a force to be reckoned with when confronting predatory animals. According to the <abbr title="Federation Cynologique Internationale | English: 'World Canine Organization'">FCI</abbr> standard mature males (in good working condition) should weigh between 77 and 99lbs & females (in good working condition) should weigh between 66 and 88 lbs. </p>
