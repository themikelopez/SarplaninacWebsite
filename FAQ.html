							<p>It is important to understand that the Sarplaninac is a working breed with the instinct to guard and alarm if they feel threatened or that something is out of the ordinary. <strong>Yes</strong>, they do bark. They are not excessive barkers or considered yappy, but they will bark to alarm any potential predators of their presence, or to bring your attention to a threat.</p>

							<p><strong>Yes</strong>, Sarplaninac do in fact shed! They have a thick double-coat that works to provide them with warmth in colder climates, as well as keeping them cool when the temperature is warmer. They have a yearly blowout of this double-coat; however, with regular brushing, their coat is very manageable. 
							<br><strong>NEVER</strong> shave a Sarplaninac! Their double-coats to not typically grow back correctly and can result in a dog that is no longer prepared for many temperatures. Consult a veterinarian if you are concerned about the coat of your Sarplaninac.</p>

							<p>Surprisingly enough, the Sarplaninac does not require a ton of food. For example, a 130lbs. male with moderate daily activity will be satisfied with roughly 4 cups of food/day. They do, however, require a quality, well-balanced food that provides them with the necessary nutrition. It is important to maintain a healthy weight to keep unnecessary pressure off of joints to avoid health issues down the road. It is also important for developing puppies to not grow <em>too</em> fast; check with your breeder to see what kind of food they use and recommend for growing Sarplaninac puppies.</p>
